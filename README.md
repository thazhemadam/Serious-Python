# Serious Python
Serious Python was a 5 day intensive course, which hoped to improve the knowledge of students with regards to Python, the more significant modules, and libraries that are popularly used, as well as good practices and writing high performance programs and code in python.
The scripts, programs, and supplementary material that were created and used as resources for the abovementioned course can be found in this repository; ordered by day (available up till day 4, since day 5 was focused on theoretical concepts regarding performance and code optimization).

In addition to covering the core topics that outlined the syllabus in sufficient depth, the course also required multiple assignments and a project to be completed, within the assigned 4 day duration of the course. The relatively significant projects have been attached as well, and can be found in the _Assignments_ directory.
The relatively more all round and requirement specific of these, is the program titled _Project_, which allows students and teachers to keep track of their attendance/courses respectively, and has mails sent out, if the attendance of a student drops below a specified percentage. It must be noted that the same credentials are no longer valid (obviously). 

The following concepts were the core concepts covered in the course.
*   Basics
*   File Handling
*   Regular Expressions
*   Network and Socket Connections
